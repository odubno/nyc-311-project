				<h1>What we learned about life in New York City</h1>

				<div id="introduction" class="div_pad">
					<h2>Introduction</h2>
						<p>
							With over 8M complaints per year, NYC’s 311 data is one of the richest and most accurate views in to the socioeconomic features and urban context of New York City’s boroughs. The original data set, provided by 311 Services, contains one record for each customer’s call including information such as: service request type, service request open/close time and date and location(longitude and latitude). With that information, we are able to build interactive views in to the What, How, When and Where in regards to these complaints, anchoring on Borough. It’s also important to note that we focused on the month of February only, due to data size complexities (will be explained further in the “challenges” section). Something to note is that all data is nominal, such as borough and even complaint type; we are

					<h2>Life in NYC</h2>
					<p>
						New York City’s publically available 311 Service Complaints dataset provides an intimate and insightful view in to the life of the city’s pain points. With an understanding of these complaints and pain-points, we can discern certain life norms. Since we can coordinate the data to show time, location and type of complaint, we can answer questions such as: “Which Borough and area has the most difficult winter?” and “When does the work day start and wind down?” and even “Which areas have the largest bar scenes and noise pollution?” Our goal is to leverage the complaints in this data set to understand what life is truly like in New York City, as told, albeit, indirectly from the people themselves.
					</p>
					<p>
						We focused on the month of February of 2018, as this is generally the coldest month, to view in to the most ancient of complaints: the cold. We took the top 15 complaint types and saw that, by far, Heat/Hot Water complaints presented a slight asymmetry. The Bronx and Brooklyn saw more than half of the Interquartile range, even though the population is less than half of the total population. And to further dissect this, The Bronx, with a population of 1.4 million, submitted nearly 7000 complaints of this type in the month of February, while Brooklyn, with a population of 2.6 million people, submitted just over 6000 complaints. Manhattan, with a 1.6 million population only submitted 4000 complaints, as a comparison. This is our first revelation, that for reasons we could postulate, such as building standards or gas pipe repairs needed, The Bronx has the most difficult winters. And on top of this, most complaints of this type occur at 10pm, so these calls are simply people too cold to fall asleep.
					</p>
					<p>
						One of the most accurate pieces of data in the dataset is the Time stamp, via complaint.hour. This information shows gives us a view in the routine of New Yorkers’ day and the obstacles they come across. View these timestamps by borough and frequency, we can see that New Yorkers take their mornings very seriously, with the peak of complaints occurring between 9am and 10am, perfectly following the hierarchy of population density to number of calls submitted. But viewing these timestamps and querying on complaint type, we can see a much clearer view on daily life. New Yorkers are very keen to complain about their neighbors making noise and preventing them from going to bed, since we can see that over 1500 complaints of Noise - Residential is submitted between 10pm and 1 am. So, contrary to popular belief, New York City is not the city that never sleeps; in fact, New Yorkers take their sleep time very seriously.
					</p>

				<div id="data" class="div_pad">
					<h2>Data</h2>
					<p>
						Here, we'll explore the journey of an idea for a project to having the data cleaned and plotted. 
					</p>
					<p>
						The initial ambition was for us to analyze one year worth of NYC complaints. The single file took 2 minutes to download and 5 minutes to load in R. The file had 2.5 million rows and was ~2gb in size. We settled for using the last month, February 2018, for the analysis.
					</p>
					<p>
						The February file is 125MB and consists of 191,314 complaints. The next obstacle was uploading the file to GitHub. GitHub limits uploads to 100MB. Given the data is public, please use this <a href="https://nycopendata.socrata.com/api/views/fhrw-4uyv/rows.csv?accessType=DOWNLOAD&query=select+*+where+%60created_date%60+%3E%3D+%272018-02-01T00%3A00%3A00%27+AND+%60created_date%60+%3C+%272018-02-28T23%3A59%3A59%27">link</a> to download 311 data for Feburary 2018. We did attempt to use <b>git LFS</b>, an extension that allows large files to exist on the repo, but it simply provided a text token that you have to use to download the data. Seemed like a waste of time to us given this data is so easily accessible.
					</p>
					<p>
						Now that the data became available to play with, it's  smooth sailing from here. There are 221 different complaint types. We chose to filter the data by the 15 most frequent complaints. The size of the data went from 191,314 to 119,877 complaints. Why did we chose to filter by the top 15 most frequent complaints? We felt that this would encompass most of the important complaints and

							Fig1. - Complaint Types filted by "Unspecified" Borough.
						</figcaption>
					</figure>
					<p>
						 The data has some missing (Unspecified) locations (Boroughs) and that's explained by "Complaint Type". Some complaints deal with documentation and information requests that don't require a location.
					</p>

					<p>
						In addition to "DOF Literature Request" being mainly responsible for "Unspecified", other complaints do have a missing "Borough" and we do not have a good explanation for why (See fig 1). This data is entered by people who receive phone calls from other people. It just takes one person to forget to ask or mention the location. We're not too worried about the missing data. It's a miniscule amount compared to what we have. If we specifically ignore "DOF Literature Request", there's only .22% of the data that is actually missing. See the code that we used to calculate that <a href="https://github.com/odubno/NYC311Project/blob/master/executive_plots/get_missing_borough_percentage.Rmd" target="_blank">here</a>.
					</p>
					<p>
						Now that the data has been filtered and clean, we jumped into plotting and analyzing. Enjoy the rest of our analysis!

				<div id="tools" class="div_pad">
					<h2>Tools</h2>
					<ul>
						<p>
							<b>GitHub</b> and <b>R</b> are the main tools here. We used <b>Google Docs</b> to edit the summaries before moving the final versions to HTML.
						</p>
						<p>
							<b>GitHub</b> helped manage our files and make our work public.
						</p>
						<p>
							This app was built using an <b>R</b> package called <b>Shiny</b>. <b>Shiny</b> is well documented and makes it really easy to spin up an app within 5 minutes. Our app took a full days work to get it working properly. 
						</p>
						<p>
							<b>GGPlot2</b>, also an R package helped make all of our plots. Well, most <b>GGMap</b> helped with making our maps. You could see all of our resources in the <i>Resources</i> tab above.
						</p>

						</figure>	
						<p>
							We took color blindness into consideration when making our plots. We use a lot of color in our plots and in order to properly discern which color represents what, we chose <b>viridis</b>, an R package, to create perceptually uniform plots.
						</p>

						<p>
							<b>viridis</b> uses four color scales (see fig2). We went with, the primary choice, "Viridis".
						</p>
						<p>
							To make our plots easier to read, we created our own theme. It subtly increases text and changes the font. We were careful not to interfere with properties that apply to people with common forms of color blindness
